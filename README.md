# Lanx

> Business operating system for freelancers — proposals, contracts, time tracking, invoicing, and payments in one connected platform.

---

## What It Does

Freelancers typically manage their workflow across 3–4 disconnected tools — Notion for proposals, DocuSign for contracts, Toggl for time tracking, Wave for invoices. Lanx replaces all of them with one system where each step feeds into the next.

A proposal becomes a contract. A signed contract creates a project. Tracked time generates an invoice. A paid invoice rolls up into your yearly report — automatically.

---

## Features

- **Authentication** — Authentication with JWT and Oauth
- **Client Management** — contact book that anchors every other entity
- **Proposals** — line-item pricing, sent via public link, client accepts without an account
- **Contracts** — auto-drafted from accepted proposals, e-signed via public link
- **Projects** — auto-created on contract signing, milestone or hourly billing
- **Time Tracking** — start/stop timer, manual entry, billable flag per entry
- **Invoices** — generated from tracked time or milestones, PDF, pay link
- **Payments** — Stripe Connect, money routes directly to freelancer's bank
- **Expenses** — log project costs, optional receipt upload
- **Reports** — yearly income, expenses, net profit, revenue by client and month
- **Email Automation** — proposal/contract/invoice notifications, overdue reminders

## System Design

### Three API Zones

```
Zone 1 — Authenticated Dashboard (JWT required)
  /api/v1/clients
  /api/v1/proposals
  /api/v1/contracts
  /api/v1/projects
  /api/v1/time-entries
  /api/v1/invoices
  /api/v1/expenses
  /api/v1/reports

Zone 2 — Public Token-Based (no login, client-facing)
  /proposals/view/:token
  /contracts/sign/:token
  /invoices/pay/:token

Zone 3 — Webhooks (Stripe, signature verified)
  /webhooks/stripe
```

### State Machines

```
Proposal  : draft → sent → viewed → accepted / declined / expired
Contract  : draft → sent → signed
Invoice   : draft → sent → viewed → paid / overdue / cancelled
Time Entry: running → stopped → invoiced
Project   : not_started → in_progress → completed
```

### Payment Flow

```
Client pays invoice
  → Stripe Checkout Session routes payment to freelancer's connected account
  → Stripe webhook fires → invoice marked paid in DB
  → Platform never holds funds (Stripe Connect Express)
```
